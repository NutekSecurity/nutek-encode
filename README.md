# Nutek Encode

![Untitled](Untitled.png)

Easily encode and decode text, files and buffers into various types of output.

## Why Nutek Encode?

I was inspired by a Perl script - [hURL](https://github.com/fnord0/hURL). I used it a lot in the past, but it was not maintained anymore. I wanted to create a tool that would be easy to use and maintain. I also wanted to learn Rust, so I decided to create this tool.

## Installation

[![Rust](https://github.com/NutekSecurity/nutek-encode/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/NutekSecurity/nutek-encode/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

From stable:

```bash
cargo install nutek-encode
```

Link to the [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nutek-encode) page.

Instructions for installing Rust can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

From source:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/NutekSecurity/nutek-encode
```

or download the binary from the [releases](https://github.com/nuteksecurity/nutek-encode/releases/latest) page.

just maybe go to the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/neosb/nutek-encode) page and pull the image.

```bash
docker pull neosb/nutek-encode
```

## Usage

![Nutek Encode showcase](https://github.com/NutekSecurity/nutek-encode/blob/827615f5396632e874a6da0010dfb10a094289cc/examples/demo.gif)

```bash
nutek-encode --help
```
or using Docker

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" | docker run -i --rm neosb/nutek-encode base64 -
```

### It is also possible to use the tool as a library

```rust
use nutek_encode_lib::encoder;

fn main() {
    let encoded = encoder::encode_base64("hello").unwrap();
    assert_eq!(encoded, "aGVsbG8=");
}
```

To do that, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
nutek-encode = "0.1.0"
```

For more inspiration, check out the [documentation](https://docs.rs/nutek-encode).
